	Represents the controller of the MVC pattern; it's not allowed to get access to the data model directly, instead
	use this package to do so. This package contains factories to create objects. Factories are always used when
	object creation would take place in other layers. Instead the creation process is done in the package in which
	the object resides and then it is passed on.
